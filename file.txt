Step on no pets. 
Live not on evil. 
Rise to vote, sir. 
No lemon, no melon.

Neil, a trap! Sid is part alien! 
Tulsa night life: filth, gin, a slut.

"Sir, I demand, I am a maid named Iris." 
"Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas." 
"T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad. I'd assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet." 
"Go hang a salami! I'm a lasagna hog." 
"Rise to vote, sir." 
"Dammit, I'm mad!" 
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!" 
"A Toyota's a Toyota." 
"Able was I ere I saw Elba." 
"Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod."
